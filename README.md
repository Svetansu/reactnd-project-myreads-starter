# MyReads Project v1.0

This project my first submission for the MyReads book-keeping react application.
I have added some information below to make undersatnding my work easier:

    -- The starter code for this project gave us one App.js file with the functionality of a Home Page and a Seach Page.
       The App.js was then separated into components, which are:
            - Book.js: Component to render each book in any shelves or search results.
            - BookRow.js: The shelves or "rows" of books are stored as a component named BookRow. 
            - HomePage.js: The main landing page, where the 3 main shelves and a button to add more books, are present.
            - SearchPage.js: The search page which is opened when a user clicks on the add button on the home page, to find new books and add them.

    -- I've opted to use React Context in my application. This allows for the easy passing down of global properties of the book shelves to be passed down easily to the HomePage and SearchPage components. This was done by the index.js component in the "Provider" directory.

Some important features of the project include:
    
    -- State management
    -- Use of APIs
    -- Search handling
    -- Routing
